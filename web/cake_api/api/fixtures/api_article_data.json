        "content": "\u201cStop calling Pok\u00e9mon Go AR,\u201d say the purists. But who cares what you call something that is so successful? Just be glad it happened, and let\u2019s figure out what it means for the AR/VR industry.Pok\u00e9mon Go is the singularity for AR/VR that everyone was waiting for, but looks very different to what everyone expected. It isn\u2019t space glasses from the future, it isn\u2019t high tech, it doesn\u2019t require new hardware and it\u2019s free. Who saw that coming?It would be fair to say that not even Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s developer Niantic did, as, despite their enormous success, the overwhelming demand from users led to reports of significant server downtime at launch (not helped by DDoS attacks).But the great thing about Pok\u00e9mon Go is that hundreds of millions of consumers aged 8 to 80 have played it worldwide, watched others play it with bemusement or read about odd experiences with it in the miles of column inches and vast numbers of electrons devoted to it by mainstream media. AR/VR is no longer the creature of industry insiders, innovators and early adopters (or TechCrunch readers). AR/VR became a mainstream phenomenon in less than a week, and it did so years before the most bullish industry insiders thought it would (us included).So why has Pok\u00e9mon Go been so successful?First, Pok\u00e9mon has a treasured place in our hearts. Millennials grew up with it, watched by doting Gen X parents and baby boomer grandparents -- it is a brand that is everywhere.Second, a pervasive platform. We\u2019re approaching 4 billion smartphone and tablet mobile broadband subscriptions this year -- a platform that is everywhere.Third, a fast core user loop. It\u2019s not the Pok\u00e9mon you played as a kid. It\u2019s even more accessible -- a core user loop that works for everyone.Fourth, a purely mobile experience. You can play it wherever you go, and wherever you go is part of why you play it. And that\u2019s key not just to the success of Pok\u00e9mon Go, but the success of all AR. Augmented reality is inherently mobile, and mobility has driven much of the tech innovation of the last decade.AR is from Mars, VR is from VenusBut still the purists will tell you, \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go is not AR.\u201d So are they right or wrong?Let\u2019s revisit some definitions. Virtual reality places users inside the virtual world, immersing them. Augmented reality overlaysvirtual objects on the user\u2019s real world, augmenting it. Although closely related to AR, mixed reality anchors apparently solid virtual objects in the user\u2019s real world. So they appear to the user as real. So far, so simple.But the technology is a bit more diverse than it first appears. Digi-Capital\u2019s Reality Matrix segments the market using a few basic definitions:    Virtual: real world is blocked out (i.e. user can only see the virtual world and virtual objects)    Augmented: real world is not blocked out (i.e. user can see the real world and virtual objects)    Immersive: the technology drivers (too deep into the weeds -- see more here) combine to trick the user\u2019s brain into reacting as though it was a real experience    Ambient: one or more of the technology drivers doesn\u2019t provide the same level of experience as Immersive (Note: this may be desirable, particularly for some augmented reality applications)The Reality Matrix is made up of four sectors, with some players operating across them to meet different user needs:Console/PC VR makes users jump out of the way when a virtual whale swims toward them under the sea (e.g. HTC Vive, Oculus, PlayStation VR);Mobile VR provides a very good VR experience, but isn\u2019t as immersive because of key drivers like positional tracking (e.g. Samsung Gear VR, Google Cardboard and Daydream);Augmented Reality ranges from the equivalent of Iron Man\u2019s holographic display with transparent virtual objects in the real world in daylight (e.g. Atheer) to smartphone/tablet \u201cmagic window\u201d AR (e.g. Google Project Tango);Mixed Reality gives users virtual objects that appear solid in the real world in daylight (e.g. Microsoft HoloLens, Magic Leap, Meta), or switches easily between AR and VR (e.g. ODG)But where does this leave Pok\u00e9mon Go?It\u2019s augmented reality, Jim -- but not as we know itHere\u2019s the bit where the purists get upset (and not just by the Star Trek misquote from The Firm). So I\u2019m just going to say it.Pok\u00e9mon Go is AR. Just a really basic version of it.In many ways, Pok\u00e9mon Go is only location-based entertainment, and not AR in the way that industry folks think about it. But that\u2019s the point. This is no longer about industry folks. It\u2019s about public perception.And the public thinks Pok\u00e9mon Go is AR. So it is.What you call it doesn\u2019t matter when you\u2019re walking around the neighborhood with your friends hunting Pok\u00e9mon. It doesn\u2019t matter that the tech is old school (GPS, clock, camera). It doesn\u2019t matter that there are no fancy optics, SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), advanced computer vision or other tech wizardry involved. None of that matters.Because it\u2019s fun. And it\u2019s everywhere. And folks think it\u2019s AR whether you like it or not. So deal with it.Everything and nothingSo what does Pok\u00e9mon Go mean for the development of AR/VR?In terms of consumer acceptance, it\u2019s monumental. People who wouldn\u2019t have been aware of or tried VR/AR/MR for years are actively engaged with the market today. It\u2019s stupendously good for the industry, because there\u2019s now mass market consumer awareness.For app developers, everyone is scrambling to figure out whether or not they can get on the bandwagon. Folks who were on the fence about devoting resources to VR/AR/MR are now at least thinking about it. And budding engineers-in-the-making who are deciding what they\u2019ll do with their careers are being influenced by it. For talent flowing into the market, that\u2019s hugely helpful.For core VR/AR/MR technology companies (i.e. the hardware guys), Pok\u00e9mon Go has had little impact on how the technology is being developed. All the challenges remain, and AR still needs that magic combination of hero device, long battery life, cellular capability, strong app ecosystem and telco cross-subsidization before it can really take off (around 2018, based on current road maps).For investors, it\u2019s been both very exciting and highly confusing. Pok\u00e9mon Go is a very specific application with a lot going for it. Hard to replicate at scale. Nintendo stock has looked more like a yoyo than a Pok\u00e9ball. So while there is more buzz around the market than already existed (if that\u2019s even possible), the underlying thinking of VCs is broadly unchanged.Apple CEO Tim Cook said it best: \u201cAR can be really great. We have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity\u2026it will be huge.\u201dOne small step for Pok\u00e9mon, one giant leap for Pok\u00e9-kind.",

        "content": "Researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology have developed a super low-power camera designed to never shut off. The system was designed specifically as a method for waking up devices, never turning off, while running off of ambient power.In order to do so, the camera had to be capable of detecting specific patterns, rather than just waking up any time if noticed motion. The camera, which made its debut at the International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (who knew such things existed?), looks for broad movement, which retaining specific details about movement, saving battery power in the process.Says Georgia Tech electrical and computer engineering professor, Justin Romberg, \u201cWhat this camera is actually looking at is not pixel values, but pixels added together in all different ways and a dramatically smaller number of measurements than if you had it in a standard mode.\u201dThe camera, which was developed during an Intel-sponsored study, could be implemented on surveillance devices, robotics or future consumer electronics.",

We've tried to leave a book review by visiting Play Store via laptop and the system required us to create a Google+ profile.

        "content": "Close partners GM and Lyft were apparently nearly even closer: The Information reportsand TechCrunch has separately confirmed that the carmaker expressed its interest in purchasing Lyft, going so far as to specify a price it would've been wiling to pay. Lyft apparently explored what other strategic partners might be offering before deciding to say no to GM and opt instead to raise new funding.Lyft declined to comment to TechCrunch on the report, but a source close to the matter confirmsthat the on-demand service providerturned down GM. GM also declined to comment on any acquisition reports, but noted that they were extremely pleased with how the strategic partnership with Lyft was going.The Information's info suggests that GM's interest in the car sharing market extends beyond simply partnering up with an external party. Other carmakers like Daimlerhave opted to own their own car sharing subsidiaries, with the German automaker operating Car2Go, and commanding a controlling stake in the merged Hailo/MyTaxi European on-demand ride provider.In statements to The Information, both companies expressed continued excitement and enthusiasm about their ongoing partnership. Most recently, this partnership has resulted in the expansion of their Express Drive program, which offers potential Lyft driverswithout their own qualifying carsthe ability to rent vehicles to use for Lyft with fees based on usage.Lyft and GM also plan to test self-driving taxis, with autonomous systems installed in all-electric Chevy Bolt vehicles. Self-driving Bolt tests using tech provided by GM acquisition Cruise have already begun in SF and Arizona.Depending on the size of the offer on the table, this could prove a risky move by Lyft. It already faces steep competition from Uber, which has far more cash on hand thanks to a series of monster equity and debt raises. Meanwhile GM could decide it wants to own its own operation, and either look around for another acquisition target like Daimler, or build an in-house on-demand ride service, which is what Ford appears to be doing with itsSmart Mobility subsidiary.Of course, the fact that GM made overtures and Lyft decided to pass this time around doesn't forego future merger potential. But it does make watching the partnership's progress far more interesting from here on out.",
